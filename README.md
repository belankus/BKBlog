## About BKBlog

BKBlog is a robust blog management system/content management system (CMS) that's built with Laravel framework.

BKBlog is a reckless project created to express thoughts and ideas in an intuitive and fun way. Starting from a hobby and interest in blogging that began in 2010, where web technology has not advanced as fast as it is now. Blogspot and Wordpress were the starting point for all beginner bloggers, including me.

With the development of website technology, with many frameworks that make it easier to build a website from scratch, I tried to recreate my first blog that was still using the Blogspot platform.
